<h1>My reflection on the project</h1>

I worked for 7 weeks on this project and it is my final project exam at noroff. During these weeks I was going to use what I have learned over my two years studying front end at noroff and make a social media site where people can register and make posts and share them with others.

I used create-react-app and react-router-dom to build the site. I used react-Bootsrap, Bootstrap and Sass to style the project.
When it comes to making components and having the code organised in folders I belive I have done a good jobb. I have multible folders that shows whats in them. And the components names are sensible in my oppinion.
